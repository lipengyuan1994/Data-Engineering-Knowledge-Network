[[Anthos]] can manage workloads

that run on your on-premise infrastructure.

So the controlling mechanism is in the cloud

but the work is being done

in your on-premise infrastructure.

So again, the distinction is less clear.

There is a significant trend toward [[multi-cloud computing]]

primarily to take advantage of additional services

and avoid vendor lock in

and to enable that kind of multi-cloud usage

Google has created Anthos, and Anthos is tailored

to running workloads on Kubernetes clusters.
