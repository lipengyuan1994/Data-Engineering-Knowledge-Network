# Objective
* Understand the performance of the model

* Metrics to monitor:
	* Traffic patterns
	* Error rates
	* Latency
	* Resource utilization 

* Configure alerts in Cloud Monitoring 

# Monitoring AI Platforms
* AI Platform exports metrics to [[Cloud Monitoring]] 
* Metrics
	* Error count
	* Latencies
	* Accelerator utilization
