41. A machine learning engineer has built a deep learning network to classify medical radiology images.  When evaluated, the model performed well with 95% accuracy and high precision and recall.  The engineer noted that the training took an unusually long time and asked you how to **decrease the training time without adding additional computing** resources or **risk reducing the quality of the model**. What would you recommend?
The correct answer is to increase the [[learning rate]]. This will allow the model to reach optimal weights faster at the risk of possibly missing the absolute optimal solution. Reducing the number of layers in the model or number of nodes in layers could reduce the quality of the model. Decreasing the learning rate would slow learning.
