1. first of all is preemptible nodes are much less expensive. I think, they're about 80% less than the cost of a typical version of that particular instance. 
2. The other reason is because Spark and Hadoop are both designed to be resilient to failures in nodes. So if Google takes back your preemptible node, that's not necessarily a problem.
